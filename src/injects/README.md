# Inject files

Directory listing of the different GAUR injection files. These files consist of the data collector code and define the routines executed when the parser performs a reduction, a shift or finishes to parse an input.
We denote the rule number by its associated line number in the generated file `nterm_list.txt`. The semantic of a rule is the computed semantic given by `gclassify`.

| `inject-pt.c`      | Outputs a sequence of rule numbers. The sequence corresponds to the post-order walk of the input's parse tree.                                                                              |
| `inject.c`         | Outputs a sequence of rule numbers and its associated semantic. The sequence corresponds to the post-order walk of the input's parse tree.                                                  |
| `inject.mysql.cpp` | Specific to MySQL to use ids generated by MySQL. Outputs a sequence of rule numbers and its associated semantic. The sequence corresponds to the post-order walk of the input's parse tree. |
