# Inject files

Directory listing of the different GAUR injection files. These files consist of the data collector code and define the routines executed when the parser performs a reduction, a shift or finishes to parse an input.
We denote the rule number by its associated line number in the generated file `rules.extracted`. The semantic of a rule is the computed semantic given by `gclassify`.

| Filename                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `inject-pt.c`                    | Outputs a sequence of rule numbers. The sequence corresponds to the post-order walk of the input's parse tree.                                                                              |
| `inject.c`                       | Outputs a sequence of rule numbers and its associated semantic. The sequence corresponds to the post-order walk of the input's parse tree.                                                  |
| `inject.mysql.cpp`               | Specific to MySQL to use ids generated by MySQL. Outputs a sequence of rule numbers and its associated semantic. The sequence corresponds to the post-order walk of the input's parse tree. |
| `simple-vector.wquery.mysql.cpp` |                                                                                                                                                                                              |


## simple-vector semantic trace format: 
In pseudo-bison code

``` 
trace:  node "|" trace |  node ; 
node: rule_number ":" action_tag ":" object_tag ; 

action_tag: STRING | %empty;
object_tag: STRING | %empty;
rule_number: INT ; 
```
